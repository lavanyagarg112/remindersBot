# remindersBot

This bot currently caters to a single group that I have. I plan on expanding it for general use in the future.

## The bot

The code for the bot can be found in the main.py file

Bot link: (to be added)

## Functionalities so far 
- Add reminders
- schedule when to get the reminder
- send a personal message also to the user (does not work with people who have never used the bot before)
- show reminders segregated by user

## Functionalities to add
- personal message reminder... require user to /start the bot before adding a reminder
- make the defaults better
- Multiple reminders for same task
- post reminders to the chatid that started it
- get reminders functionality could be better and more useful
- handle errors in a better way
- change reminders
- cancel reminders

## Requested functionalities
